It is not about bits, bytes and protocols, but profits, losses and margins. (Lou Gerstner) If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization. (Gerald Weinberg) If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution. (Robert Sewell) That’s the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers. (Larry Niven) The best performance improvement is the transition from the nonworking state to the working state. (J. Osterhout)

(Jeff Atwood) The only people who have anything to fear from free software are those whose products are worth even less. (David Emery) Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it. (Brian Kernighan) Writing code has a place in the human hierarchy worth somewhere above grave robbing and beneath managing. (Gerald Weinberg)
